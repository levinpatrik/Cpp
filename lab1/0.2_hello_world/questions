1)If you invoke touch hello.cpp prior to invoking make;
– How many files were rebuilt?
– Why?

After 'touch' on hello.cpp both files needs to be re-built. 
This is due to the dependencies of main.cpp (dependent on hello.o which is created by hello.cpp).

2) Why do you think make checks the modification timestamp of the relevant files as part of deciding what to do?

It checks the timestamp of the latest modification and compairs it with the latest compile time. If the modification has been done after the last complile you need to re-compile that file (it might have changed).
